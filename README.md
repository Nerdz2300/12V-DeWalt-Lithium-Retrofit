# 12V DeWalt Lithium Battery Retrofit

## Project Start Date: 5/07/2018

Plan is to rebuild a old/bad DeWalt battery and Retrofit it with some lithium cells that I pulled from a used laptop battery

It will have a 12.6V Charger, +/-20mV Accuracy, 1A charge rate. 2 LEDs, one for Charging, one for Done

Cells will be configured as follows:2 Parallel,3 Series which will give us 12.6V at 4000mAh. Each cell is 2000mAh

Each cell in series will have to be balanced, so a balancer is needed. 

This is untested thusfar, but I have built the main circuit before which does work. Everything else is extra. 

To Do:

* BOM for Charger

* Balancer Circuitry

* Balancer BOM

* Build and Test Charger

* Build and test Balancer

* Build the actual pack
